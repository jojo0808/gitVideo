# Introduction
git != github
Definition (git): software, already installed on your computer (macOS/linux) 
Definition (git): a memory card for code. To save your progress as you go. We enter a command to save our progress so we can goback to our saved progress as we wish. The files are saved locally

# Git Commands
+ init command

```git init 		# this is equivalent to putting a memory card in the game console```

+ add command
```git add <file(s)> 				
#	what we want to save. a specific file or all files #e.g git add file or git add. 
# the latter inicates pushing changes on all files in the current directory = add all the files-to-be-saved to the staging area```

+ commit command
```git commit 			#commits all files in the staging area into memory (actual saving command)```
```git commit -m 			# commit + adds message -> a message that describes the saves(to understand the progress)```

+ log command
```git log 			#to check the log of all the saved changes # there is a hash code that allows you to go back to a specific saved progress```

+ checkout command
```git checkout <commit_hashcode> 			# to checkout a commit (a previously saved progress) = go back to a specific progress```

__NB__: when you go back to a saved progress, you automatical change branches
